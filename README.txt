The OpenNLP wrapper can be run using the following command:

F:\OpenNLP>java -jar OpenNLPWrapper.jar fileList

fileList: a tab separated list of files. On each line the file 
contains the file name (with the full path) to be annotated by the wrapper, a 
tab for separation and the file name (with the full path) where the results of the 
annotation should be saved. The output file will be automatically generated by the wrapper.
